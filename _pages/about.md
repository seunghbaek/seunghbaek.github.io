Improving our understanding of Earthâ€™s hydroclimate over the past century to millennium is critical to better characterizing and predicting hydroclimate change in the coming decades. Towards that end, I research extratropical hydroclimate and its downstream impacts over the Common Era using a combination of observational data, high-resolution paleo-proxies, and state-of-the art climate models. The arc of my research spans (i) hydroclimate extremes in relation to climate variability and/or change, (ii) mechanisms of climate variability affecting hydroclimate, and (iii) downstream impacts of hydroclimate on climate change adaptation and mitigation. For more information on my professional activities and my research see my Publications page, [Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=Jwx84OwAAAAJ&hl=en), or see my [CV](https://seunghbaek.github.io/files/CV.pdf)
