Improving our understanding of Earthâ€™s hydroclimate is critical to better characterizing and predicting climate change in the coming decades. Towards that end, I research hydroclimate and its  impacts over the Common Era using a combination of observational data, high-resolution paleo-proxies, and state-of-the art climate models. The arc of my research spans (i) hydroclimate extremes in relation to climate variability and/or change, (ii) physical mechanisms of climate variability affecting hydroclimate, and (iii) regional to global modeling to improve climate resilience. For more information on my professional activities and my research see my Publications page, [Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=Jwx84OwAAAAJ&hl=en), or see my [CV](https://seunghbaek.github.io/files/CV.pdf)
