Iâ€™m a climate scientist studying the global hydroclimate. I focus on hydroclimatic extreme events (droughts and extreme precipitation), hydroclimate variability, and applications of global hydroclimate. For more information on my professional activities and my research see my Publications page, [Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=Jwx84OwAAAAJ&hl=en), or see my [CV](https://seunghbaek.github.io/files/CV.pdf)
